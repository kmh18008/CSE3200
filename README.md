### Stopwatch App :stopwatch: <img src="https://github.com/sciencepal/sciencepal/blob/master/assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> 
- The Stopwatch app has three independent timers on separate screens that survive screen changes and rotation.
- A model, fragment, and unittests are included for each.
- Each screen can be navigated using the three buttons located at the bottom:
    + Home
    + Dashboard
    + Notifications
- Each timer has three buttons that work according to their name:
    + Start
    + Stop/Pause
    + Reset
- Below is a representation of the technical issues I faced during this project:
