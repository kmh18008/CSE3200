## Briefly describing the status of my system
- Fragments: **Home**, **Dashboard**, and **Notification**
- Each fragment has three independent timers. Each timers have three buttons to be controlled over:
    + "Start": Start the timer, either from 0, or where we left off when hitting "Pause"
    + "Stop/Pause": Temporarily pause the timer
    + "Reset": Reset the timer to 0
- All timers survive thoroughout changes: screen changing, phone rotation.
- Additional feature: 
    + In **Home**: I added incremented counter to increment the timer 
- All tests are part. A part of LiveData tests is consulted by indicated Github link
